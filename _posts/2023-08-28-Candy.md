## Problem

There are `n` children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array `ratings`.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:
- Each child must have at least one candy.
- Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

_Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children._

### Example : 1
```textmate
Input: ratings = [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
```

### Example : 2
```textmate
Input: ratings = [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.
```

## Approach : 1 

- This questions becomes much easier if we break down the answer 2 ways.

- First condition states `Each children must have atleast 1 candy` 
  - Lets initiate an array called `candy` which will hold how many candies a child gets
  - Pre-fill the array with 1 since each kid must have atleast 1 candy
- For the 2nd condition, we need to compare each kid with its neighbours, which are left and right.
  - Lets first only compare the neighbours with left and then only with right

```text

Ratings: [1 ,2 ,2]
Candy :  [1, 1, 1] <- Prefilled list

Now, We go from left to right
          A  B          For each R[A] > R[B] we need to give 1 more candy to A than B
Ratings: [1 ,2 ,2]
Candy :  [1, 1, 1]
leftToR :[1, 1, 1]
Now, We go from Right to left
             A  B   For each R[A] < R[B] we need to give 1 more candy to B than A
Ratings: [1 ,2 ,2]
Candy :  [1, 1, 1]
RtoL  :  [1, 2, 1]

```

- At this point, we have satisfied the 2nd condition with, 
  - LeftToRight = Left neighbour satisfied
  - RightToLeft = Right neighbour satisfied
  - To mix them up for each kid = we take the `Max(LeftToRight,RightToLeft)`

```java
public int candy(int[] ratings) {
    if (ratings == null || ratings.length == 0) {
        return 0;
    }

    // Lets give each person 1 candy
    int[] candy = new int[ratings.length];

    // Each kid should have atleast 1 candy
    Arrays.fill(candy, 1);

    for (int cur = 1; cur < ratings.length; cur++) {
        if (ratings[cur] > ratings[cur - 1]) {
            candy[cur] = candy[cur - 1] + 1;
        }
    }

    // Go from right to left
    for (int cur = ratings.length - 2; cur >= 0; cur--) {
        if (ratings[cur] > ratings[cur + 1]) {
            // We need to use Max here
            candy[cur] = Math.max(candy[cur], candy[cur + 1] + 1);
        }
    }

    int total = 0;
    for (int i : candy) {
        total += i;
    }
    return total;
}
```
