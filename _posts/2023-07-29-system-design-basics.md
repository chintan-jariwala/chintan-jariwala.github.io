## Basics of System Design

The most popular and common place where Software Engineers struggle to understand and make mistakes.

This is not just an area of issue of SDEs, but also for Project/Product managers trying to get to their PMT roles. (For higher salaries)

### Why is this required ?

As with any project, once we start thinking about monetization, we need to think about the scale at which our product will operate.
Usually this is where the issue starts, because the smallest of decisions can make a hugh impact at scale.

Examples :
- A company that redesigned its warehouse layout saved $1 million per year in labor costs.
- A hospital that redesigned its patient intake process saved $500,000 per year in administrative costs.
- A manufacturing plant that redesigned its production line saved $2 million per year in energy costs.
